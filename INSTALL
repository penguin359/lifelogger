Install Photocatalog in 3 easy steps.  Lines beginning with $ are
commands to run as a local user and lines beginning with # are run as
root.

1.  Run the installer.  Add -f to install.pl to overwrite existing
configuration files.

	$ ./install.pl

2.  Setup Crontab based on examples/crontab created by installer.

	$ crontab -e

3.  (optional) Setup email alias for receiving text and photo updates.

	Alternate 1: (requires root)
	Copy the example alias from examples/aliases to the system
	aliases file, most likely at /etc/aliases or /etc/mail/aliases.
	# newaliases

	- Or -

	Alternate 2:
	Copy the example procmailrc entry from examples/procmailrc to
	your local .procmailrc in $HOME.
