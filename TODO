Loren's TODO List

Turn mobile.pl into a more generic KML filter
Improve settings infrastructure
Better support upgrading
PostgreSQL
MySQL
SQLite
Twitter Geotagging
Generic RSS support
Multiple GPS sources
Other types of GPS sources
Windows Support
  Cygwin and ActivePerl
Lock without needing KML file
More fine-grained locking
Eliminate usage of system() and open("|")
Develop test suite.
and much more...

Windows Issues:
  Need wget
  Easily installing dependencies
    XML::RSS and XML::Atom are particularly problematic
  Pathnames use backslash
  Cron replacement
  Email replacement
  system() and open("|") use Command Interpreter instead of shell.


  Currently updatelocation.pl runs under cygwin, but it fails with a
  read error in Expat.pm in ActivePerl.  Nothing else tested.
