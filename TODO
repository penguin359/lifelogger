Extend functionality to .THM thumbnail/metadata files and their corresponding video files.
Correctly import .GPX files into database to improve its accuracy (fixing for absent TZdata if needed).
Correctly import .csv sensor data/other data into database and correlate time to existing location tags.
Create list of fields in files to import
Copy rss.pl to twitter.pl, adapt to use improved twitter XML, adapt install.pl to have an option for inputting twitter username & converting that to the user_id key, offer option to download entire twitter archive for user to provide ability to historically geotag photos.

Loren's TODO List

Turn mobile.pl into a more generic KML filter
Improve settings infrastructure
Better support upgrading
PostgreSQL
MySQL
SQLite
Twitter Geotagging
Generic RSS support
Multiple GPS sources
Other types of GPS sources
Windows Support
  Strawberry Perl, ActivePerl, and Cygwin
More fine-grained locking
Eliminate usage of system() and open("|")
Develop test suite.
Better testing of Unicode/UTF-8.
Properly support :locale instead of forcing utf8.
Expand on TIPS and time zone issues
Support POST for InstaMapper
Save files in a safer manner
  Save to .bak
  unlink original
  rename
and much more...

Windows Issues:
  Need wget (Fixed)
  Easily installing dependencies
    XML::RSS and XML::Atom are particularly problematic
  Pathnames use backslash (Fixed?)
  Cron replacement (Windows Task Scheduler?)
  Email replacement
  system() and open("|") use Command Interpreter instead of shell.
