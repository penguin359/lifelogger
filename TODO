Photo Cataloging Script TODO List

Completed Steps:
GeoTagging of images
Library building

Remaining Steps:
jpegtran image manipulation
  rotate, optimize, progressive
Embed original filesize & filename in comment tag
Determine timezone from GPS location
Determine whether DST is in-effect based on date & timezone data
Ensure GPSTimeStamp tag is written correctly in UTC
Move images to YYYY/MM-Month/DD/HHMMss.jpeg and write log file
Write out daily KML file that includes all datapoints, images, Twitter updates, and other log entries.
Write out monthly KML file that includes 1 datapoint every 15 minutes (?), and all file/log entries.
Write out yearly KML file that includes all file/log entries.
Extend functionality to .THM thumbnail/metadata files and their corresponding video files.
Correctly import .gpx files into database to improve its accuracy (fixing for absent TZdata if needed).
Correctly import .csv sensor data/other data into database and correlate time to existing location tags.
Create list of fields in files to import
Update twitter.pl to use native Twitter xML
Offer option to download entire twitter archive for user to provide ability to historically geotag photos.  See example URL:  http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline.xml?page=$NN&user_id=$UID


Loren's TODO List

Turn mobile.pl into a more generic KML filter
  Multi-file output
  Remove list of XPaths
  Add in XPaths from one file to another
Improve settings infrastructure
  Multiple file names
  findSources with multiple types
  Support disabled sources
  Config max time diff for geotagging photos
  Config time diff for auto-track, segs
  Config time diff for timediff.pl
  Config file path for photos
  Add source for photos
Twitter.pl
  Support StatusNet
  Config by API URL
  Config by Site with API auto-discovery
  Username/Password and OAuth
Better support upgrading
PostgreSQL
MySQL
SQLite
Twitter Geotagging
Generic RSS support
Multiple GPS sources
  Using fancy XPath expressions
Other types of GPS sources
Windows Support
  Strawberry Perl, ActivePerl, and Cygwin
  cygwin
    libsqlite3_0
    libsqlite3-devel
    sqlite3
    postgresql-client
    postgresql-devel
    gcc4
    gcc4-core
    gcc4-g++

    perl -MCPAN -eshell <<EOF
    o conf build_requires_install_policy yes
    o conf prerequisites_policy yes
    o conf commit
    EOF

    DBD::SQLite

    Digest::SHA1
    Net::MySQL
    DBD::mysqlPP

    DBD::PgPP

    Clone
    SQL::Statement
    Text::CSV_XS
    DBD::CSV
More fine-grained locking
Eliminate usage of system() and open("|")
Develop test suite
Better testing of Unicode/UTF-8
  Test with ASCII, Latin-1, Windows-1252, Chinese, Klingon, Cuniform
Configuration test-suite
  Check old-style Perl config
  Check multiple XML file names
  Check disabled sources
  Check duplicate id
  Check duplicate name
Properly support :locale instead of forcing utf8
Expand on TIPS and time zone issues
Support POST for InstaMapper
Save files in a safer manner
  Save to .bak
  unlink original
  rename
    This would interfere with fine-grained locking
Try an use relative URLs to make KML file more useful without needing a web server
Simple script to create certain constructs like Folders in KML
Better example webpage
Upload form for images, comments, and GPX data
email.pl and scan.pl support GPX and comments
Multiple trips/paths
Debian/Ubuntu packages
Android app to easily push GPX/images/comments
Android app replacement for InstaMapper
uuidgen for Atom
Description
Lossy image manipulation with GD
Maintain a log file
Facebook, FourSquare, and Twitter integration
My Photo Gallery Integration
Plugin Support
Duplicate detection
Filename collision handling
Feed Validation
lockKml timeout
Flickr/Facebook config
Generic cmdline options support
Make files use full path and path configurable
  mobile.kml
  images.csv
  backend files
    timestamp
    locations.csv
Triple check timestamp code
Add bounds detection for map
Filter bogus points
Add app info hash
  Name
  Description
  Usage
  Option
Add -help
Non-JPEG support
Improved REST API for PhotoCatalog for Android
  Query list of valid sources
Wake PhotoCatalog on SMS
Send email to Android from Perl
Does Android auto-fill type for content:?
Check on FileSpec, Basename, and my use of paths.
Test with chdir('/var/empty') and drop $cwd
Check for undefined Subject and Date in email.pl
Better CGI Handling
  eval over dies such as failed to find source.
  use bytes on escaping
geotag.pl currently broken, should check all other scripts as well
and much more...

Windows Issues:
  Easily installing dependencies
    XML::RSS and XML::Atom are particularly problematic
  Pathnames use backslash (Fixed?)
  Cron replacement (Windows Task Scheduler?)
  Email replacement
  system() and open("|") use Command Interpreter instead of shell.
