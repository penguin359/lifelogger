This is a collection of perl scripts for downloading location data,
geotagging photos, and creating a KML file documenting it along with
Twitter and other messages displayed along the path at the location it
was made.  This KML file can then be overlayed on Google Maps or Google
Earth.

updatelocation.pl - This is the most important script as it pulls
location data from InstaMapper and updates the path in the KML file.

rss.pl - This reads a RSS feed such as Twitter and posts the comments in
the KML file based on location data retrieved by updatelocation.pl.

mobile.pl - This creates a mobile version of the KML file.
