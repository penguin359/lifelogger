This is a collection of perl scripts for downloading location data,
geotagging photos, and creating a KML file documenting it along with
Twitter and other messages displayed along the path at the location it
was made.  This KML file can then be overlayed on Google Maps or Google
Earth.

This files are listed roughly in order of importance.

install.pl - Installer.  See INSTALL for usage.

updatelocation.pl - This is the most important script as it pulls
location data from InstaMapper and updates the path in the KML file.

lock-kml.pl - Locks the KML file for 10 minutes.  Useful when hand
editing the KML file to prevent cron jobs from interfering.

rss.pl - This reads a RSS feed such as Twitter and posts the comments in
the KML file based on location data retrieved by updatelocation.pl.

scan.pl - Scans a directory for photos and updates KML with them.

email.pl - Received email and extracts photos and descriptions from them.

mobile.pl - This creates a mobile version of the KML file.

timediff.pl - Scans CSV file for large gaps in updates and reports them.

geotag.pl - (Not ready yet.)

test.pl - (Not ready yet.)
